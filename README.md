## BFS Puzzle

1. We can run the code by Executing the main.py using the following command, no external libraries were used:

**python3 main.py**

2. Uncomment the different **start_state** and **goal_status** to test the two test cases and you may add more but with the same variable name

3. You can access all the nodes generated in the three txt files:

**nodePath.txt, Nodes.txt, NodesInfo.txt**

4. All the txt files are overwritten each time so it doesnt matter if there is pre-existing data in the files

5. Also run python3 **plot_path.py** to visualize the minimum steps required to reach the goal from the starting state.

**python3 plot_path.py**
